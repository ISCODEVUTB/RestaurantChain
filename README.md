RESTAURANT CHAIN

A restaurant chain operates on legacy POS systems, separate loyalty programs, mobile apps, overhead inefficient. Data is isolated across systems, limiting customer insights. Scaling requires replicating changes across systems. Adding new data/features requires complex coordination.

The fragmented systems limit the restaurant chain's ability to deliver seamless omni-channel experiences. For example, promotions and ordering are not integrated across POS, mobile apps, and loyalty programs. This results in inconsistent messaging and experiences. The company needs cross-channel data sharing to enable personalized engagements, inventory coordination and process optimization.

The solution involves building microservices oriented around restaurant capabilities like ordering and loyalty programs. These would expose customer, sales, and menu data APIs managed by a gateway. This data is streamed to a cloud analytics platform for ML optimization. This approach incrementally decomposes monoliths over time into focused, decoupled services that deliver unified data access through standardized APIs. There are some specifications:

Develop microservices for ordering, loyalty, pricing, promotions.

Expose customer, menu, sales data via APIs controlled by a gateway.

Stream API data into a cloud analytics platform.
